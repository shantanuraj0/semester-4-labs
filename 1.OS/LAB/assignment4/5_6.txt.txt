// this contains d and e part


d) If we remove usleep calls in the program  then the  writer will writes all from 2 to 4 and will initialize the data =0 and will finish.
     Now the data is 0, so all readers will also finish themselves.
     So  reading and writing will not be able to be done properly by the writer threads and the reader threads.
  


e) Due to usleep(apt delay time), no reader will suffer starvation in this
 implementation because each reader will get a chance to  read and will 
  get its operations done corresponding to the write.
